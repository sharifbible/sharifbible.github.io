The past year we've been working non-stop to finish edits, improvements, and layout for SAB 2021. We are now approaching the final stages of layout and are very excited about this edition - the best, most accurate, most helpful edition ever.

In future blog posts we'll share some of the changes and improvements with you. But for now, one new feature will be in the margins. We've cleaned up and improved our marginal expalanatory note. More importantly, however, we now have maps in the margins so readers can identify locations and distances. This will be a great help to newer readers unfamiliar with biblical locations.

The Sharif Study Bible has be 2nd in line for our attention, but it too will soon be a focus of effort and concern. Book introductions are written and some 200 Articles have been composed and edited with our readers in mind.

Keep praying for us as ISBS as the work of making God's Word understandable and accessible to all continues!
