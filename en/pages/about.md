| ![ahlan wa sahlan](/assets/img/ahlan-wa-sahlan-with-text.png) | Dear Visitor, we're happy you've stopped by to visit *The Sharif Bible*. We hope you enjoy our site and find it helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to write us at **info@sharifbible.com**.

The Sharif Bible is an Arabic translation of the Bible made primarily for Muslim readers, but many traditional Arab Christians throughout the Middle East and North Africa also love it because of the ease and clarity of its language.  

The Sharif Bible is managed by the *International Sharif Bible Society* (ISBS), a non-denominational, faith-based, non-profit Society. ISBS is committed to translating the Bible into Arabic that is simple and clear and that communicates the message of the Bible to all Arabic-speaking peoples.  

Translation of the Gospels began in 1975 and quickly expanded to include dozens of professionals from various denominational backgrounds (translators, linguists, Hebrew and Greek Scholars, theologians and consultants) who have cooperated for decades now to produce this first ever translation of the entire Bible for the majority population and the emerging Arabic-speaking Church from Muslim communities.  

You can read and listen to the Sharif Bible on your mobile phone as well! Don't miss our links to those apps. |
