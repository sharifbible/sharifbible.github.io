About us...

The Sharif Bible is an Arabic translation of the Bible primarily for Muslim readers and for the emerging Church from Muslim communitities, but many traditional Arabic speaking Christians also enjoy the Sharif. The Sharif Bible is managed by the International Sharif Bible Society, a non-denominational, faith-based nonprofit Society committed to translating the Bible into Arabic (and other languages) for Muslims around the world.

Work began on the Gospels in 1975 and quickly expanded to include dozens of professionals from various denominational backgrounds (translators, linguists, Hebrews and Greek Scholars, theologians and consultants) who have cooperated for decades now to produce this first ever translation of the entire Bible for Muslims and the emerging Arabic-speaking Church from Muslim communities.

Founder of ISBS writes, "While living in North Africa, I was constantly in conversation with Muslim friends and neighbors, sharing my faith and discussing the Bible. I quickly discovered how inaccessible the message of the Arabic Bible was to Muslim readers and saw how great the need was for a simpler translation that made use of terms, phrases and idioms Muslims were familiar with and which they could understand. I translated the Gospel of Mark first (1975) and tested it. Later the entire New Testament was published (1990), and eventually the entire Bible (2000)."
