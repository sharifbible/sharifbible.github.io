# Our Story

While living in North African, I was constantly in conversation with Muslim friends and neighbors, sharing my faith and discussing the Bible. I quickly discovered how inaccessible the message of the Arabic Bible was to Muslim readers and saw how great the need was for a simpler translation that made use of terms, phrases and idioms Muslims were familiar with and which they could understand. I translated the Gospel of Mark first (1975) and tested it. Later the entire New Testament was published (1990), and eventually the entire Bible (2000).

Our initial work expanded to include dozens of professionals from various denominational backgrounds (translators, linguists, Hebrews and Greek Scholars, theologians and consultants) who have cooperated for four decades now to produce this first ever translations of the entire Bible for Muslims and the emerging Arabic-speaking Church from Muslim communities.

The International Sharif Bible Society is a non-denominational, faith-based nonprofit Society committed to translating the Bible into Arabic (and other languages) for Muslim readers and for those who have come to Christ from Islam.
