## Sharif Study Bible

We’re happy to announce an ongoing project – the Sharif Study Bible. The goal of this study edition is to help you understand and be enriched by God’s Word and share its truth with other. Whether you share one-to-one or in a group setting, sharing God’s Word is part of our proclamation. Effective proclamation doesn’t focus only on presenting information. Rather, it is the Word’s own active call which involves my first hearing God’s voice addressing me from the Word and my helping others in learning to experience the same thing as God meets each person’s needs and provides answers to questions we each ask. An effective proclamation or sermon or presentation comprises this practical application which follows as we properly hear God’s Word.

Some of the features you’ll find in the Sharif Study Bible include commentary on the biblical text, carefully composed articles that are relevant to today’s issue, maps, charts, illustrations, book introductions and other material.

The Sharif Study Bible is presently being produced, but we’re able to make available here a small sample. This sample includes our first attempt to layout some of the features, and we did so using Paul’s Pastoral Letters (1&2 Timothy and Titus). We are constantly improving the layout, but you’re welcome to download this sample (in Arabic only)
