# Future home of the Sharif Bible

Thanks for visiting! Our website is presently under some reconstruction, so please bear with us while that is underway. In the meantime, a few of the essential features are available.

- Please visit our About pages for both Arabic and English words of welcome and introduction.
- Click on our Why the Sharif? page for a bit more about why we believe the Sharif Bible is important to making the Scriptures and the message of Jesus as clear and meaningful as possible to as many Arabic speaking Muslims as possible.
- Our Order page is working if you're interested in ordering any Sharif Bibles, New Testaments, or our Luke|Acts Arabic-English Diglot.

We hope soon to have other resources available again - portions of the Sharif Bible to read and download as well as other devotional and instructional publications you can download for free, a sample of the Sharif Study Bible, and personal words from friends whose lives were changed when they met the Sharif Bible.

Feel free to contact us with any suggests or questions you might have at:

info@sharifbible.com

Follow us at Twitter and on Facebook and enjoy reading or listening to the Sharif Bible on your cell phone!
