title: New Sharif site welcomes you
permalink: /ar/blog/first-post

We are happy to announce the launch of our rebuilt website. Our older site has gone. It was better than no online presence at all, but it fell short of providing visitors the experience we want them to have. We hope the new site is helpful, and we invite you to explore its pages and resources. We still have some small improvements to make, but we’re redesigned enough to welcome you in.

If you’re reading this, you’ve found your way to our Sharif Blog which we’ll use to share news items, prayer requests, educational posts about the Sharif translation, and inspiration thoughts taken from the Sharif Bible.

Check out our Why the Sharif? page under the Menu options also. You can download the full Arabic booklet or a much smaller, abridged representation of the main content in English.

There’s a ‘Suggestions & Questions’ box on the Home Page as well if you ever wish to drop us a note. We’d love to hear from you.
