The Sharif Bible is an Arabic translation of the Bible primarily for Muslim readers, but many traditional Arabic speaking Christians throughout the Middle East and North Africa also love it because of the ease and clarity of its language. 

### More information
The *Sharif Bible* is managed by the **International Sharif Bible Society** (ISBS), a non-denominational, faith-based non-profit Society. We're committed to translating the Bible into Arabic that is simple and clear and that communicates the message of the Bible to all Arabic speaking peoples.

Translation of the Gospels began in 1975 and quickly expanded to include dozens of professionals from various denominational backgrounds (translators, linguists, Hebrews and Greek Scholars, theologians and consultants) who have cooperated for decades now to produce this first ever translation of the entire Bible for Muslims and the emerging Arabic-speaking Church from Muslim communities.

You can read and listen to the Sharif Bible on your mobile phone too!
