## The carousel YAML file defines each of the images and text content used by the home page
## for the main hero carousel, a bootstrap component (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/).
## The carousel data includes the image, the alignment of the caption, and the caption content
## in each of the languages.
## To add a new image, just add a new data item, defined below:
## -
##   pos: a numeric position, should be in order and start at 0 (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3). 
##        The 0 pos item is always active first.
##   path: the path to the image (usually in the assets folder)
##   alt: the html "alt" content, something to describe the image for visuall impaired viewers
##   quoteposition: the alignment (left, right) of the text, so that it doesn't overlay an
##        important part of the image.
##   (repeating section for each language)
##   [lang]: the language identifier (en, ar, etc) for the translated content to show
##     title: the title of the quote
##     caption: the caption, which should follow the standards of YAML for escaping quotes. So, if
##         quotes are included in the caption, surround the entire caption with quotes, and escape the
##         internal quotes, e.g. "this is an \"escaped quote\" in YAML."
